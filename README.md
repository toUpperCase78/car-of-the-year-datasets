## About

_Car of the Year_ is one of the most prestigious award for car manufacturers that produce and sell cars in Europe continent.

Every year, more than 30 different candidate cars are determined as in a provisional, then finalized list. Later, several of them are selected to be nominees (in recent years, there are 7 cars as nominated). And, points are given to each one by tens of juries from many different European countries, with regards to engine, performance, handling, comfort, exterior-interior design, easiness and innovative technologies. Finally, in a well-known car exhibition that is held in Spring season, the winner is announced to take the Car of the Year award.

This repo contains datasets for all winners and nominees, which competed for this award, since 1964 as well as their total points accumulated from juries. Plus, all voting grids for nominated cars between 2010 and 2020.

## Datasets

Here, you can find two different types of datasets to inspect:

* The first type (called `carOfTheYear_winners_nominees` in a CSV file) encompasses all winners and nominees with their total points, starting from 1964, up to the present.
* The second type contains voting grids for individual years, from 2010 to 2020 (called `carOfTheYearXXXX_votingGrid` in CSV files). Thus, 11 different datasets are available.

## Notable Facts

* In 2002-2020, there are 7 cars nominated to be the Car of the Year; except in 2013, the number of nominated cars was 8.

* ___For the dataset that has all the winners and nominees___, the order of the columns first show the winner car with its point, then the second-placed one with its point, and so on, for each year.
* ___For the datasets about voting grids___, each row begins with the country and jury name, then his/her point distribution to all nominees. The leftmost number represents the point given by the jury to the award-winning car; likewise, the rightmost one is the point to the last-placed nominee. The columns have been set accordingly to reflect this order.
